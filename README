megatools - command line client application for Mega
====================================================

Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from a command
line of your desktop or server.

Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory trees
to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads for example to
preview videos and audio files, without needing to download the entire file.

Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega servers
allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at minimum. Megatools
can upload 70MiB/s and download 80 MiB/s on a cheap single core Intel based VPS.

You can register mega account using the 'megatools reg' tool, with the benefit
of having true control of your encryption keys, compared to using mega.nz web
client. Anything done in the web browser uses a code you don't have control over
(unless it's your own website), and thus can't be fully trusted with your
password.

Mega website can be found at https://mega.nz.
